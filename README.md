## Tracy - The Smart Assistant

Tracy is a voice-controlled smart assistant developed with Node.js . The first 2 models of this assistant, which I have always dreamed of, were made when I first started learning software development (and who knows where are they now).

Everyday, current model is developing and named with "mark 3.x". When there is a major change, it will be upgraded to a higher model.
